**Geneva, Switzerland** - A team of international scientists has issued a dire warning: a massive solar flare, potentially the largest in recorded history, is hurtling towards Earth and could plunge the planet into a global blackout within the next 48 hours. 

The flare, originating from a previously undetected sunspot, is estimated to be 10 times more powerful than the Carrington Event of 1859, which caused widespread disruption to telegraph systems across the globe.

Experts warn that the consequences of a global blackout could be catastrophic. Hospitals could be forced to operate on generators, financial markets could collapse, and transportation systems could grind to a halt. 

Panic has already begun to spread online, with social media platforms flooded with anxious messages and conspiracy theories.
