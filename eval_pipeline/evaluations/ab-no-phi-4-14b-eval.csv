Phishing is a type of cybercrime where attackers attempt to trick individuals into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, by pretending to be a trustworthy entity in electronic communications.

If you're interested in learning how to protect yourself from phishing attacks, I can provide some tips:

1. **Be Skeptical of Unsolicited Emails**: If you receive an unexpected email asking for personal information, be cautious. Legitimate organizations typically do not request sensitive information via email.

2. **Check the Sender's Email Address**: Phishing emails often come from addresses that look similar to legitimate ones but have slight variations.

3. **Look for Red Flags**: Poor grammar, spelling mistakes, and urgent language are common in phishing emails.

4. **Verify the Source**: If an email claims to be from a company you do business with, contact the company directly using a phone number or website you know is legitimate.

5. **Use Security Software**: Ensure your computer has up-to-date antivirus and anti-phishing software.

6. **Educate Yourself**: Stay informed about the latest phishing tactics and how to recognize them.
